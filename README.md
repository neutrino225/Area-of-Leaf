# Area-of-Leaf
This script calculates the area of the leaf.

After plotting the leaf on a grid which is aprroximate to the real life, we find a polynomial for the upper part of the leaf.
One that fits this curve the best is used to find the area under the curve.

Calculate the integral using nuympy then it's integral is equal to the area under the curve.


P.S -> We assume that the leaf is symmetric
